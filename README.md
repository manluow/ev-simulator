## Run
```
python run.py
```


## Simulator Details

### Environment
The simulator operates on a 2D space with hexagonal partition with discrete time. There are three key elements: 
1. Shared EVs with certain range and charging time
2. EV Stations with different numbers of charging docks (parking spaces)
3. User orders with describes their demand at different timestamps


### Data
We also provide a set of sample data for the simulator to run. In practice, such data can be generated by learning from the real operation logs of the EV sharing system. More concretely, we provide the following data:
1. Geometric details of the hexagon partition (`hex_pos_info.csv`)
2. Properties of EV stations (`station_seq_info.csv`)
3. User demand in one week (`orders_one_week.pkl`)
4. Station network dynamics in one week (`daily_online_offline.pkl`)

### Run Simulation 
At the beginning of each timestamp, the simulator performs the following:
1. Implement the station dynamics: i.e. making certain stations online or offline
2. Process rent demand: assign the orders within this timestamp to different EVs at the stations specified by the users
3. EV status update: keep tracking the status of each EV, if it is parked or running, its battery status, if its order has been completed, etc.
4. Process return demand: charge the EV at the destination stations, and handle cases such as if there isn't enough parking space for an arriving EV.

### Entry for Rebalancing Strategies
One could plug in their own rebalancing strategies in the following function: 

```
def rebalance_cars_across_hexagon(self, car, action, order_money=-1, average_dis=-1)
```

It is also possible to directly implement rebalancing strategies in the simulator. We leave the readers to explore further. 


### Output 
At each timestamp (currently set to 10 mins), a snapshot should be generated to show current status (including various statistics) of the simulation. The log will also be stored in ```logs/log.txt```. Here is a sample output:

```
